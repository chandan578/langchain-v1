      "Okay, so I need to provide details about the movie Bahubali. Let me start by recalling what I know. Bahubali is a big Indian film, part of a two-part series. I think it's directed by S.S. Rajamouli, who's known for his epic films. The title might be a mix of Telugu and Sanskrit words, but I'm not sure exactly what it means. The main characters are probably named Bahubali and maybe his family, perhaps some rivalry between two brothers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first part, Bahubali: The Beginning, was released in 2015. The sequel, Bahubali 2: The Conclusion, came out in 2017. Both were massive hits in India and internationally. The film is in Telugu but was dubbed into other languages like Hindi, Tamil, and Malayalam. It's a mythological drama with elements of action, romance, and political intrigue. The story is set in a fictional kingdom called Mahishmati.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lead actors are Prabhas and Rana Daggubati. Prabhas plays the protagonist, Bahubali, while Rana Daggubati plays his half-brother Bhallala Deva. Tamannaah Bhatia and Anushka Shetty also star as the female leads, Sivagami and Devasena, respectively. The story revolves around a long-standing feud between two families. There's a legend about a king whose descendants are the heroes, and the current conflict is between the sons of the same king but from different mothers.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember that Bahubali is the son of a king who was usurped by his half-brother. The protagonist grows up in hiding, seeking vengeance. The films cover his journey from a young boy to a powerful warrior. There are elements of betrayal, love triangles, and political conspiracies. The visual effects are a big part of the films, especially the famous \"waterfall fight\" scene in the first movie.\n",
      "\n",
      "The soundtrack is composed by M.M. Keeravani, and the songs are very popular. The films were a box office success, with the second part being one of the highest-grossing Indian films at the time. They also received critical acclaim for their storytelling, direction, and performances. The films helped boost the careers of the lead actors and set a benchmark for big-budget Indian cinema.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also mention the production details. The films were produced by Rajamouli's own production company, and they were made with a huge budget, which was unprecedented in Indian cinema. The second film was shot in multiple locations, including China and South Korea, and had a lot of CGI work. The story is inspired by a local Telugu legend, which Rajamouli adapted into the screenplay.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to check if there are any inaccuracies here. For example, the exact meaning of \"Bahubali\"—I think it means \"one with great strength\" or \"strong-armed.\" Also, confirming the release years: 2015 and 2017. The actors' names are correct. The main conflict is between the two brothers, with Bahubali being the good guy and Bhallala Deva the antagonist. The films have a lot of emotional depth, especially the relationship between Bahubali and his mother, and the love story between Bahubali and Sivagami.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another point is the budget. The first film was around INR 300 crore, and the second was even higher, making them the most expensive Indian films. The success of the series led to the creation of a prequel, Bahubali: The Beginning Remake or another related project? Wait, no, the series is just the two films. There was talk of a third film, but I think it's not happening. The legacy of the films is significant, influencing many other epic films in India.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also mention the themes: family rivalry, duty versus desire, revenge, and redemption. The films explore the consequences of past actions and the importance of truth. The visual style is grand, with elaborate sets and costumes. The use of CGI for battle scenes and locations like the waterfall and the palace is notable.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the key points are the director, lead actors, plot summary, production details, box office success, critical reception, and cultural impact. I need to structure this information in a coherent way, making sure to highlight important aspects like the unique elements that made the films stand out, such as the scale, the story, and the technical achievements.\n",

Let me start by recalling what I know about RRR. It\\'s a 2022 Indian film directed by SS Rajamouli. The genre is action and drama, and it\\'s known for its high-octane sequences. The main actors are Ram Charan and Jr. NTR. Now, the user also mentioned the famous song. RRR has a song called \"Naatu Naatu\" which became very popular.\\n\\nWait, the tools provided require specific parameters: name, director, year, rating, genre. The user wants the movie details and the famous song. But the function is for the movie, not the song. So I need to focus on the movie\\'s details. The song might be part of the movie\\'s description, but the function doesn\\'t have a parameter for songs. Hmm, maybe just include the song in the genre or another field if allowed. But according to the function\\'s required parameters, it\\'s name, director, year, rating, genre. The song isn\\'t a parameter here. So perhaps I need to provide the movie details and mention the song separately, but the function call can only include the movie\\'s data. \\n\\nLet me check the function again. The function is called \"Movie\" and requires the specified fields. Since the user also wants the famous song, maybe after calling the function, I can mention the song in the response. But the user\\'s instruction says to call the function if needed. So first, I need to call the Movie function with the details of RRR. The song isn\\'t part of the function\\'s parameters, so I can\\'t include it there. Therefore, the function call will handle the movie details, and then I can separately state the famous song in the response. \\n\\nNow, let\\'s gather the data for the function. The movie name is RRR, director is SS Rajamouli, year is 2022, genre is action and drama. The rating is a bit tricky. I think RRR received a high rating, maybe around 8.5 or 9 on IMDb.
